          <h3>About Margaret </h3>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)"> <p>Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist, systems engineer, and business owner. She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program. She later founded two software companies‚ÄîHigher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
        
        <p>Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings and reports about sixty projects and six major programs. She is one of the people credited with coining the term "software engineering".</p>
        
        <p>On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.</p></blockquote>

      <h3> Career</h3>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)">In Boston, she initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis. However, in the summer of 1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at MIT. She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC. Her work contributed to Lorenz's publications on chaos theory. At the time, computer science and software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience. She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement.</blockquote>

            <h4> - SAGE Project</h4>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)"> <p>From 1
              961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab,
               where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), 
               used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft. She also wrote software for a satellite 
               tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories. The SAGE Project was an extension of Project
                Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements 
                using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense from potential Soviet attacks
                 during the Cold War. Hamilton said: </p>
              <q><cite>What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which
                 nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had 
                 happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments
                  were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers
                   in Latin and Chinese. I was the first one to get it to work.</cite></q>
              <p>It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo 
                flight software.</p>

      <h4> - Apollo Program</h4>
      <blockquote cite="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA_%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86"><p>At one of the defining moments of the Apollo 11 mission , the Apollo guidance computer and in-flight flight software successfully averted the moon landing. The computer raised several alarms three minutes before the Lunar Lander arrived on the surface of the moon. The on-board flight software picked up these alarms with "never-supposed-to-happen" displays, and interrupted the astronauts with priority warning displays. And Hamilton prepared it for this condition only years ago.</p>

<p>There is another failure that Hamilton likes to remember. Her innovation of "priority display" created a secondary risk of losing synchronization between the astronaut and the computer when the matter was critical. With the alarms suppressed and priority displays replaced by regular screens, the actual transformation of new software behind the screens was happening "slower" than it is today. </p>

        <p>Hamilton thought this carefully. This meant that if Aldrin pressed a button on the Priority Shows screen very quickly, he might still get a "normal" response. The solution was: When you see the priority offers screen, count to five first.</p> 

<p>The astronauts inadvertently left the automatic radar switch on, causing these alarms to sound. The computer was overloaded with faulty phase interruptions for the ASD. The program‚Äôs alerts indicated ‚Äúexecutive violations,‚Äù which means that the directional computer was unable to complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. Hamilton's team used the asynchronous execution designed by G. Halcom Laing to develop asynchronous flight software.</p>

        <p>Hamilton's priority warning displays interrupted regular displays of astronauts to warn them of an emergency "to give the astronauts an opportunity to choose whether to follow or not to follow (landing or not landing)". Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in the mission control room, acknowledged the meaning of the errors presented to the astronauts through priority displays and chanted, "Go, go!" And they keep going. Paul Curto, the chief technologist who nominated Hamilton for the NASA Prize for Space Law, described Hamilton's work as "the basis for designing super-reliable software."</p>

<p>Hamilton later wrote about the incident: The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to realize that it was taking orders to do more than it should. So I send an ultimatum that means to the astronaut: ‚ÄúI am overloaded with tasks than I should be doing at the moment, and I will only keep the most important tasks‚Äù; That is, the tasks needed to land ... in fact, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error states. A full suite of recovery software is included in the software. The software action, in this case, was to cancel the low priority tasks and recreate the most important ones ... had the computer not recognized this problem and had not taken recovery actions, I doubt Apollo 11 would have landed as successfully as it landed on the moon.</p>

  <h3>Legacy </h3>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)"><p>Anthony Oettinger, Barry Boehm,[citation needed] and Hamilton have been credited with naming the discipline of "software engineering". Hamilton details how she came to make up the term "software engineering": </p>
    <q><cite> When I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.</cite></q>
    <p>When Hamilton started using the term "software engineering" during the early Apollo missions, software development was not taken seriously compared to other engineering, nor was it regarded as a science. Hamilton was concerned with legitimizing software development as an engineering discipline. Over time the term "software engineering" gained the same respect as any other technical discipline. The IEEE Software September/October 2018 issue celebrates the 50th anniversary of software engineering.Hamilton talks about "Errors" and how they influenced her work related to software engineering and how her language, USL, could be used to prevent the majority of "Errors" in a system. Writing in Wired, Robert McMillan noted: "At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer". Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the moon. According to Wired's Karen Tegan Padir: "She, along with that other early programming pioneer, CoBOL [sic] inventor Grace Hopper, also deserve tremendous credit for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM fields like software</p>
    <p>In 2019, to celebrate 50 years to the Apollo landing, Google decided to make a tribute to Hamilton. The mirrors at the Ivanpah plant were configured to create a picture of Hamilton and the Apollo 11 by moonlight.</p>
